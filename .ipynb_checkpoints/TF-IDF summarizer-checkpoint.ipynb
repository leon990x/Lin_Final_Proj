scurrying for safer ground .\\r\\nPresident Carlos Flores Facusse declared a state of maximum alert and the Honduran military sent planes to pluck residents from their homes\\r\\non islands near the coast .\\r\\nAt 0900 GMT Tuesday , Mitch was 95 miles ( 152 kilometers ) north of Honduras , near the Swan Islands .\\r\\nWith winds near 180 mph ( 289 kph ) , and even higher gusts , it was a Category 5 monster _ the highest , most dangerous rating for a storm .\\r\\nThe 350-mile ( 560-kilometer ) wide hurricane was moving west at 8 mph ( 12 kph ) .\\r\\n` ` Frightened people are moving into the mountains to search for shelter,\\' \\' he said .\\r\\nIn El Progreso , 100 miles ( 160 kilometers ) north of the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa , the army evacuated more than 5,000 people who live in low-lying banana plantations along the Ulua River , said Nolly Soliman , a resident .\\r\\nBefore bearing down on Honduras , Mitch swept past Jamaica and the Cayman Islands .\\r\\nRain squalls flooded streets in the Jamaican capital , Kingston , and government offices and schools closed in the Caymans , a British colony of 28,000 people .\\r\\nThe strongest hurricane to hit Honduras in recent memory was Fifi in 1974 , which ravaged Honduras \\' Caribbean coast , killing at least 2,000 people .Hurricane Mitch paused in its whirl through the western Caribbean on Wednesday to punish Honduras with 120-mph ( 205-kph ) winds , topping trees , sweeping away bridges , flooding neighborhoods and killing at least 32 people .\\r\\nMitch was drifting west at only 2 mph ( 3 kph ) over the Bay Islands , Honduras \\' most popular tourist area .\\r\\nIt also was only 30 miles ( 50 kms ) off the coast , and hurricane-force winds stretched outward 105 miles ( 165 kms ) ; tropical storm-force winds 175 miles ( 280 kms ) .\\r\\nThat meant the Honduran coast had been under hurricane conditions for more than a day .\\r\\n` ` The hurricane has destroyed almost everything,\\' \\' said Mike Brown , a resident of Guanaja Island which was within miles ( kms ) of the eye of the hurricane .\\r\\n` ` Few houses have remained standing .\\r\\n\\' \\' At its , 4th graf pvsHurricane Mitch cut through the Honduran coast like a ripsaw Thursday , its devastating winds whirling for a third day through resort islands and mainland communities .\\r\\nAt least 32 people were killed and widespread flooding prompted more than 150,000 to seek higher ground .\\r\\nMitch , once among the century \\'s most powerful hurricanes , weakened today as it blasted this Central American nation , bringing downpours that flooded at least 50 rivers .\\r\\nIt also kicked up huge waves that pounded seaside communities .\\r\\nThe storm \\'s power was easing and by 1200 GMT , it had sustained winds of 80 mph ( 130 kph ) , down from 100 mph ( 160 kph ) around midnight and well below its 180 mph ( 290 kph ) peak of early Tuesday .\\r\\nHouston accountant Kathy Montgomery said that she and her friend Nina Devries had tried to leave Cancun but found all the flights full .\\r\\n` ` It \\'s been horrible,\\' \\' said Montgomery , as she and her friend drank cocktails at an outdoor restaurant .\\r\\n` ` We could n\\'t go out on a boat , we could n\\'t go snorkeling .\\r\\n` ` Even Carlos \\' N Charlie \\'s and Senor Frog \\'s are closed,\\' \\' she said dejectedly , referring to two

Emergency Commission said Saturday .\\r\\nMitch _ once , 2nd graf pvsIn Honduras , at least 231 deaths have been blamed on Mitch , the National Emergency Commission said Saturday .\\r\\nEl Salvador _ where 140 people died in flash floods _ declared a state of emergency Saturday , as did Guatemala , where 21 people died when floods swept away their homes .\\r\\nMexico reported one death from Mitch last Monday .\\r\\nIn the Caribbean , the U.S. Coast Guard widened a search for a tourist schooner with 31 people aboard that has n\\'t been heard from since Tuesday .\\r\\nBy late Sunday , Mitch \\'s winds , once near 180 mph ( 290 kph ) , had dropped to near 30 mph ( 50 kph ) , and the storm _ now classified as a tropical depression _ was near Tapachula , on Mexico \\'s southern Pacific coast
